# Pose probability distribution (Implicit-PDF)

This repository contains code and resources for the Implicit-PDF project. It includes scripts for generating artificial training data using BlenderProc, as well as helper functions to load and manipulate this data.

## Generating Artificial Training Data Using BlenderProc

Artificial images are generated in the `blenderproc` folder. BlenderProc is a modular data processing pipeline for Blender.

To generate data, navigate to the `blenderproc` directory and run the appropriate scripts (Please replace "appropriate_script.py" with the actual name of your script):

```shell
cd blenderproc
python appropriate_script.py
